"""Tests for priority-tiered scheduling on the Lick/Kast path.

Created by JXP and Claude.

The guarantee that matters most here is the negative one: with every
target at the default priority the tier loop must reduce to the single
`schedule_greedy` call it replaced, so adding this feature cannot have
changed any night anyone has already planned.

The positive one is the reason the feature exists -- a target the greedy
earliest-window-close-first pass bumps (the FRB20250408A case recorded in
context/claudes_brain.md v0.37/v0.38) must survive once it outranks the
targets that were crowding it out.
