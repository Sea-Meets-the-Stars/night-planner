# Claude's Brain — night-planner

This file is Claude's persistent memory for the **night-planner** project. As I
learn about night planning, the telescope, the author's preferences, and how this
repository is organized, I record the durable, reusable knowledge here — the
things a fresh session would want to know. A dated **Version History** at the
bottom tracks every update.

## Project purpose

- Teach Claude to generate a **night plan for a modern, professional telescope**,
  learning from two professional astronomers (J. Xavier Prochaska, `jxp@ucsc.edu`,
  and a colleague).
- Longer-term goal: a **GitHub-hosted webpage dashboard** monitoring all of the
  author's Claude-assisted projects.

## Working conventions (from CLAUDE.md)

- **Git:** the author runs all git commands; I use only read-only git.
- **Calculations:** always write them as a Python script to disk (reproducible),
  never inline-only.
- **Logging:** same approach as the ClimateIntelligence repo — a daily narrative
  log I write at `Logs/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, plus `Logs/log_summary.csv` written
  automatically by the `Stop` hook (`.claude/hooks/log_usage.py`). CO2 ≈ 0.076 g
  per 1,000 tokens. See [`../Logs/logging.md`](../Logs/logging.md).
- **Coding:** Python; methods not classes; imports at top; docstrings with
  inputs/outputs; matplotlib/seaborn/Bokeh for plots; `"Created by JXP and Claude"`
  header on every file and docstring.

## Repository layout (as of 2026-07-11)

- `CLAUDE.md` — guidance for Claude (this project's rules).
- `claude_prompts/start_up.md` — ordered start-up prompts driving initial setup.
- `context/` — durable context; `claudes_brain.md` (this file).
- `Logs/` — daily narrative logs, `log_summary.csv`, `logging.md`.
- `.claude/` — `settings.json` (Stop hook wiring), `hooks/log_usage.py`.

## Astronomy / night-planning knowledge

- _(To be filled in as I learn the telescope, instruments, targets, and the
  astronomers' night-planning workflow.)_

## Version History

- **v0.1 — 2026-07-11:** Created during start-up prompt 1. Seeded project purpose,
  working conventions, and repository layout. Astronomy/night-planning knowledge
  section is a placeholder pending the astronomers' input.
