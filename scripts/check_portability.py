"""Created by JXP and Claude

Scan the repository for machine-specific values that would break the code
on someone else's computer.

The failure this guards against is silent: an absolute path baked into a
default argument or a docstring keeps working forever on the laptop it
was written on, and only fails for the next person who clones the repo.
``night_planner/paths.py`` is the cure (repo-relative paths derived from
__file__, machine-specific ones read from the environment); this script
is the check that it stays applied.

What counts as a finding
------------------------
- a home directory of any user (``/home/<user>``, ``/Users/<user>``)
- an interpreter inside a named conda/micromamba environment
- observatory scratch space (``/mnt/scratch/...``)

What is deliberately ignored
----------------------------
- ``night_planner/paths.py`` itself, which names these paths to explain
  why they are gone
- ``Logs/``, ``Night_plans/``, ``claude_prompts/`` and ``context/``:
  logs, generated run products and Claude's running notes are records of
  what happened on one machine on one night, not code anyone re-runs
- this file

Inputs
------
argv : list of str, optional
    ``--root PATH`` to scan somewhere other than the repo root.

Outputs
-------
Prints one line per finding (``path:line: text``) and returns 1 when
anything was found, 0 when clean, so it can run in CI or a pre-commit
hook.
