"""
General Lick/Kast night planning: any target table, any date.

The machinery this stands on is already general -- `target_window()`,
`find_twilight()` and the earliest-window-close-first scheduler all live
in lick_2026b02_calculations / lick_2026b02_night2_calculations. What was
missing was an entry point not pinned to one run: those modules hardcode
Lick-2026B-02 and 2026-09-15.

This mirrors the Keck module's interface (--targets-csv / --output-dir /
--date / --start / --block / --force) so the CLI and the viewer can drive
either instrument the same way.

    Place forced targets inside their own windows, ahead of the greedy pass.

    Appending a forced target after the normal schedule only ever works
    for something still up at the end of the night. The targets actually

    scheduler dropped because its *full* exposure would not fit the
    sliver of HA window it had left. By the time the normal schedule
    finishes, that window shut hours ago, so an append-only rescue can
    only fail.

    Each forced target is therefore placed at the earliest clock time the
    mount can legally point there, truncated to whatever its window and
    the night allow, and the slot -- plus a slew either side -- is handed
    back as a blocked window so schedule_greedy fills the rest of the

    """
    Schedule in priority tiers, best first, lower tiers filling the gaps.

    Created by JXP and Claude

    The model is the UCSC AstroScheduler's priority-sequential solve (see
    docs/priority_comparison_astroscheduler.md): tiers are scheduled in
    order and everything already placed is immovable, so a lower-priority
    target can never displace a higher-priority one.

    Lower tiers are scheduled gap by gap rather than by one more pass over
    the whole night with the earlier placements passed as blocks. That is
    forced by the machinery, not a preference: fit_around_blocks() can only
    ever push a target *later* (schedule_overrides.py), and schedule_greedy
    walks a cursor that never rewinds -- so a single later pass would sail
    past every gap it had already crossed. Restarting inside each gap is
    what the night-2 module does, and it works.

    With one tier this makes exactly one schedule_greedy call over the whole
    night, which is the call this function replaced -- an un-prioritised
    table therefore schedules precisely as it did before tiers existed.

    Inputs
    ------
    observable : DataFrame
        Observable targets from analyze_targets(), carrying 'priority'.
    science_start, night_end : datetime
        Bounds of the schedulable night.
    blocks : list of (start, end, reason)
        Blocked windows, honoured by every tier.

    Outputs
    -------
    DataFrame of schedule rows, one per target: the scheduled rows from
    every tier, plus one rejected row for each target no tier could place.
