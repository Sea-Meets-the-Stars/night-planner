"""Where everything lives, worked out rather than written down.

Created by JXP and Claude

Hardcoded absolute paths like ``/home/lordrick/Projects/night-planner`` were
scattered through this repo, which meant the code only ran on one laptop.
``night_planner/make_lick_night_plan.py`` already carried a ``/home/xavier/...``
default that had been broken on the other author's machine for months -- the
failure mode is silent until someone else runs it.

Paths split into two kinds, and they want opposite treatment:

**Inside the repo** -- the repo root, ``Night_plans/``, ``scripts/``. These are
*derived* from this file's own location and are never configurable. Making them
settings would be strictly worse: one more thing to get wrong, and they cannot
be wrong when computed.

**Outside the repo** -- the FFFF-PZ checkout, the Lick night-plan template on
``/mnt/scratch``. These genuinely differ per machine, so they read from
environment variables, with a sensible guess where one exists and a plain error
naming the variable where it does not.

Environment variables
---------------------
``NIGHT_PLANNER_PLANS``
    Plan output directory. Defaults to ``<repo>/Night_plans``.
``FFFF_PZ_REPO``
    The ``chime-ffff-pz`` checkout. Defaults to a sibling of this repo, which
    is how both authors have it laid out.
``LICK_NIGHT_PLAN_TEMPLATE``
    The template .xlsx the Lick workbook builder copies its checklist from.
    No default -- it lives on observatory scratch space with no portable
    location.
