## Target security
In most cases, This code is in a public repo peoples targets are private
So we need them in a git ignored folder

1. We need to scrub all our real targets from the repo, starting with all night plans

2. Set a path for /home/lordrick/Projects/night-planner/pvt_Nighplans on environmental variables and add it to git ignore

## Prompts
1. Identify all our real target files and their info

2. Make a plan to remove them from git and git history all branches and all commits

3. Setup the pvt_Nightplans path for our code to access

As usual, I will handle all the git commands

# Execution — Claude (Opus 5.5), 2026-11-09

No real target name or position is written in this file. Names and positions
are kept only in the git-ignored `pvt_Nighplans/_scrub/`.

## Prompt 1 — Inventory of real targets

**Tool:** [`scripts/scan_private_targets.py`](../scripts/scan_private_targets.py)
(run in `frb_env`). It

1. builds a catalogue of real targets from `pvt_Nighplans/`. Sources are every
   CSV name column (TNS, Pri/Sec names, candidate galaxies), every starlist,
   finder file names, and FRB/TNS/J-name tokens in any text, `.xlsx` or `.pdf`.
   It drops synthetic `SIM*` rows and flux standards (BD/Feige/HZ/…);
2. catalogues their **positions** as (RA, Dec) string pairs: decimal degrees
   truncated to 3 dp, plus sexagesimal `hh mm ss` / `hh:mm:ss`. A file counts
   as leaking a position when it holds both the RA and the Dec of one target,
   so a position is still caught after its name has been removed;
3. scans every tracked file at HEAD (text, office-zip XML, PDF via `pdftotext`)
   and **every blob in every commit on every branch** (36 commits).

Report (paths and counts only, safe to commit):
[`Logs/private_target_scan.md`](../Logs/private_target_scan.md).

**Totals:** 1650 real names and 817 real positions catalogued. 235 files at
HEAD leak them; 239 paths across history.

| Class | What | Real names / positions | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Raw plan data** | `Night_plans/` (all 11 run dirs: CSVs, starlists, xlsx, finder PNG/JSON, plan_result.json) | up to 1523 names / 603 positions per file | **Remove from all history** |
| | `Keck-2026B-02_test1000/` (repo root) | 20 / 20 | **Remove from all history** |
| | `claude_prompts/night_plans/*.md` (3 run prompts) | up to 19 / 6 | **Remove from all history** |
| **B. Run-specific scripts** | 13 `scripts/{lick_2026b0*,keck_2026oct06_*,make_lick_2026b02_*,make_keck_2026oct06_*,build_lick_2026b02_night2_plan,check_deadtime_lick_2026b01}.py` | up to 14 / 7 | Pseudonymise + blank positions (or move private, see D2) |
| **C. Narrative records** | `Logs/2026/08–10/*.md` (15 files), `context/claudes_brain.md`, `scripts/document_pipeline_workflow.md`, `tests/test_data/TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md`, `claude_prompts/development/user_comments_implementation.md` | up to 34 / 8 | Pseudonymise + blank positions |
| **D. Code / docs / tests** | `README.md`, `docs/{Shane_telescope_constraints,priority_comparison_astroscheduler,target_csv_guide}.md`, `backend/app.py`, `night_planner/lick_tub.py`, `scripts/{make_observing_report,target_visibility,make_keck_2026oct06_targetlist}.py`, `tests/{test_observing_log,test_priority_tiers,test_targets_io,test_backend}.py` | 1–9 names each; **`test_targets_io.py` and `test_backend.py` hold real host positions with the name stripped** | Pseudonymise; hand-fix the two tests (see step 2) |
| **History only** | `docs/priority_system.md` (old versions, 2 commits) | names | Pseudonymised by the same pass |
| Clean | `docs/*.pptx`, `docs/*.pdf`, `test_targs/`, `examples/`, `frontend/`, `Logs/log_summary.csv` | 0 | — |
| False positive | `tests/test_data/*.csv` (26 files): the synthetic generator's `FRB2026MMDDx` names happen to equal **2** real TNS names, with made-up positions | 2 / 0 | Leave (excluded from rules); optionally regenerate with `SIM` names |

Two scan bugs were fixed along the way. Flux standards spelled `bd284211`
(lower case) were counted as targets. And `cand_gal_names` cells hold Python
list strings, which merged several names into one.

## Prompt 2 — Plan to remove them from git and all history

**Tool:** `git filter-repo` (not installed yet:
`conda install -n frb_env -c conda-forge git-filter-repo`). One pass does two
things:
- `--invert-paths --paths-from-file claude_prompts/target_scrub_paths.txt`
  drops the class-A folders and the 13 moved scripts from every commit. That
  file is public (paths only), and the scan script reads the same file, so the
  two never drift apart.
- `--replace-text pvt_Nighplans/_scrub/replace_text.txt` rewrites the contents
  of every kept file in every commit. It replaces 1650 real names with stable
  codes (`TGT0001` …), blanks 12 exact positions, and applies 13 hand-made
  rules (`_scrub/extra_rules.txt`) that map old test fixtures holding real
  positions to the made-up values now in the tests.

All rule files are **private**. `pseudonyms.csv` is the only way back from a
code to a real name.

**Checked (2026-11-10):** `scan_private_targets.py --filter-out
pvt_Nighplans/_scrub --verify` applies the rules to all 373 versions of every
kept file in history, plus the new docs. It finds **0 names, 0 exact
positions, and 0 rounded positions**. The one remaining hit is a coincidence:
magnitude and S/N numbers in the Kast comparison CSV.

### Decisions (answered by LK, 2026-11-10)

- **D1. Names and positions?** *"Yes TNS names are public but we need not to
  show plans to everyone, scrub both as long as we are keeping our copy in
  pvt."* → Both are scrubbed. This includes the two real names that the
  synthetic fixtures had reused: one of them is a real Lick-2026B-01 target
  discussed in the kept docs. The fixtures get the same codes everywhere, so
  the tests are unaffected.
- **D2. Move the run scripts?** *"Move them, I have already copied the files
  to pvt_Nightplans, not sure what you mean by this, elaborate."*
  → **What it means:** copying `Night_plans/` covered the plan *data*. The
  run-specific *scripts* live in `scripts/` and were not copied. "Move" =
  copy them into the private dir **and** remove them from every commit.
  **Finding:** 4 of the 17 run-named scripts are not one-offs; they are the
  planner engine and must stay:
  `keck_2026oct06_calculations.py` (`cli.py calc`, `adapters.py`, 5 tests),
  `lick_2026b02_calculations.py` and `lick_2026b02_night2_calculations.py`
  (`kast_calculations.py`, tests), and `lick_2026b01_calculations.py`
  (`tests/test_data/run_all_tests.py`). They stay public with names replaced
  by codes. Renaming them to run-neutral names is a separate refactor.
  The other **13 were copied** (byte-identical) to
  `pvt_Nighplans/{Lick-2026B-01,Lick-2026B-02,Keck-2026B-02}/scripts/` and
  listed in `target_scrub_paths.txt`. Nothing kept imports them. Also copied
  into the private dir: `claude_prompts/night_plans/*.md` →
  `pvt_Nighplans/_prompts/`, and `Keck-2026B-02_test1000/`. **Not deleted from
  `scripts/`:** Claude Code's safety check blocks `rm` here; `git rm` them in
  step 0.
- **D3. Rescue the docs?** *"Yes"* → `docs/Lick-2026B-01_HOWTO_night_plan_creation.md`
  and `docs/Lick-2026B-01_CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md` were cleaned with the same
  rules (`--apply-to`), and the Dec column of the one RA+Dec table is
  withheld. Each has a provenance note. `docs/data/kast_exposure_model_comparison{,_sn10}.csv`
  hold magnitudes only. Links were updated in `README.md`, `docs/README.md`,
  `docs/Shane_telescope_constraints.md`, `etc.py`,
  `compare_kast_exposure_models.py`, `adapters.py` and
  `lick_2026b02_calculations.py`.
- **D4. GitHub?** *"delete and recreate"* → steps 5–6 below.

### Steps (LK/JXP run every git command)

```bash
# 0. LK, in ~/Projects/night-planner on develop -------------------------------
#    (Claude has done all non-git prep: tests use made-up positions, docs
#     rescued, links fixed, private copies made; 145 tests pass.)
git rm scripts/check_deadtime_lick_2026b01.py \
       scripts/build_lick_2026b02_night2_plan.py scripts/build_lick_2026b02_night_plan.py \
       scripts/lick_2026b02_extras.py scripts/lick_2026b02_finalize_starlists.py \
       scripts/lick_2026b02_nonfrb_finders.py scripts/lick_2026b02_sep15_revision.py \
       scripts/make_lick_2026b02_night2_starlist.py scripts/make_lick_2026b02_nonfrb_starlist.py \
       scripts/make_lick_2026b02_starlist.py scripts/keck_2026oct06_filler_search.py \
       scripts/keck_2026oct06_rejection_analysis.py scripts/make_keck_2026oct06_targetlist.py
git add -A        # .gitignore now hides pvt_Nighplans/ and Night_plans/
git status        # check: no pvt_Nighplans/ paths staged
git commit -m "Target scrub prep: private plans dir, rescued docs, fake test coords"
git push origin develop
#    Optional: merge develop into main first, so main also carries .gitignore.

# 1. Freeze, and record what deleting the repo will lose ------------------------
#    Tell everyone: no pushes, no PR merges until step 6.
#    JXP: write down the forks (Insights -> Forks), collaborators/teams,
#    branch protection, Pages, secrets, webhooks, description/topics.
#    Save any issue/PR discussion worth keeping.

# 2. Backup. Keep it PRIVATE and outside any repo; delete when satisfied.
git clone --mirror git@github.com:Sea-Meets-the-Stars/night-planner.git \
    ~/backups/night-planner-PRE-SCRUB.git

# 3. Rewrite a fresh mirror -----------------------------------------------------
conda install -n frb_env -c conda-forge git-filter-repo
git clone --mirror git@github.com:Sea-Meets-the-Stars/night-planner.git /tmp/np-scrub.git
cd /tmp/np-scrub.git
git filter-repo \
    --invert-paths \
    --paths-from-file ~/Projects/night-planner/claude_prompts/target_scrub_paths.txt \
    --replace-text   ~/Projects/night-planner/pvt_Nighplans/_scrub/replace_text.txt

# 4. Verify before anything leaves the machine ---------------------------------
git clone /tmp/np-scrub.git /tmp/np-verify && cd /tmp/np-verify
git log --all --name-only --format= | grep -c '^Night_plans/'      # expect 0
cp -r ~/Projects/night-planner/pvt_Nighplans .                       # git-ignored
conda run -n frb_env python scripts/scan_private_targets.py --out /tmp/scan_after.md
#   expect "Files at HEAD mentioning them: 0" and "Paths in history ...: 0"
conda run -n frb_env python -m pytest -q -m "not network"

# 5. JXP (admin): delete and re-create on GitHub -------------------------------
#    Settings -> Danger zone -> Delete this repository.
#    New repository: Sea-Meets-the-Stars/night-planner, public, EMPTY
#    (no README, licence or .gitignore).
cd /tmp/np-scrub.git
git remote add origin git@github.com:Sea-Meets-the-Stars/night-planner.git  # filter-repo removed it
git push origin 'refs/heads/*'     # all branches; NOT --mirror (skips refs/pull/*)
git push origin 'refs/tags/*'      # none today; harmless
#    Then set the default branch, re-add collaborators, branch protection,
#    Pages and secrets. Consider not re-pushing the stale branches
#    keck-2026oct02 / Lick-2026oct12.

# 6. Everyone re-clones. An old clone that pushes would bring the history back.
mv ~/Projects/night-planner ~/Projects/night-planner.OLD
git clone git@github.com:Sea-Meets-the-Stars/night-planner.git ~/Projects/night-planner
mv ~/Projects/night-planner.OLD/pvt_Nighplans ~/Projects/night-planner/
#    Carry over any other untracked files you need, then delete .OLD.
```

Commit messages contain no real names (checked), so `--replace-message` is not
needed.

**Deleting the repo** removes the PR refs (#1–#4) and the old commits served
by URL in one go, with no Support ticket. **Forks are the exception.** When a
public repo is deleted, its forks survive with the full old history, and the
old commits may stay reachable through the fork network. Check the forks in
step 1 and ask their owners to delete them. For reference:
[GitHub: Removing sensitive data from a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).

### Who can do which step

The repo belongs to the `Sea-Meets-the-Stars` org. "Admin" below means an org
owner or a repo admin (probably JXP). These are GitHub's general permission
levels; your org's settings may tighten them.

| Step | Who |
|---|---|
| 0: `git rm`, commit, push develop | LK (write access) |
| 1: freeze; record forks and settings | JXP (admin, for settings) |
| 2–4: backup mirror, `filter-repo`, verify | Anyone with read access (all local) |
| 5: delete and re-create the repo, push, restore settings | Admin; the org may limit deletion to org owners |
| 6: re-clone | Every collaborator, on every machine |
| Deleting a fork | That fork's owner |

**Assume exposure.** The repo was public, so anyone may already have cloned
it. The rewrite only stops further exposure.

**Prevention** (done in prompt 3): plans default to a git-ignored directory, a
test guards the `.gitignore`, and `scan_private_targets.py` (with `--coarse`
and `--verify`) can be rerun at any time. Optional: a pre-commit hook that
runs the scan on staged files.

I could not check visibility, forks or PR refs from here: `gh` is not
authenticated, and the SSH remote needs an interactive key.

## Prompt 3 — `pvt_Nighplans` path for the code

- `pvt_Nighplans/` was already a full copy of `Night_plans/`
  (`diff -rq`: identical).
- [`night_planner/paths.py`](../night_planner/paths.py): `plans_dir()` now
  returns `NIGHT_PLANNER_PLANS` when set, else **`<repo>/pvt_Nighplans`**
  (new `PRIVATE_PLANS_DIR`). Before this it fell back to the tracked
  `Night_plans/`. Every user of `plans_dir()`/`plan_dir()` follows: CLI,
  backend `PLANS_ROOT`, `_safe_dir`, `/api/plans`.
- **Env var set** for the conda env:
  `conda env config vars set NIGHT_PLANNER_PLANS=/home/lordrick/Projects/night-planner/pvt_Nighplans -n frb_env`.
  It takes effect on the next `conda activate frb_env`. LK/JXP on other
  machines do the same with their own path. Without it the default still
  lands in the private directory.
- [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore): `pvt_Nighplans/` **and** `Night_plans/` (safety
  net for old commands and docs that still say `--output-dir Night_plans/…`).
  Note that ignoring does not untrack the files; step 2 above removes them.
- Tests: `tests/test_observing_log.py` and `tests/test_backend.py` now read the
  real Keck plan through `plan_dir()`, so they run locally and skip elsewhere.
  `tests/test_paths.py` asserts the new default and has a new test,
  `test_private_plan_directories_are_git_ignored`.
- Small follow-ons: the `backend/app.py` comments and docstrings, the
  `scripts/check_portability.py` skip list, the frontend output-dir
  placeholder (`pvt_Nighplans/…`; `_safe_dir` would reject `Night_plans/…`),
  and the env-var tables in `README.md` and `INSTALL.md`.
- **Tests:** `145 passed, 1 deselected` in `frb_env` (offline IERS). With
  `NIGHT_PLANNER_PLANS=/nonexistent` the six real-plan tests skip cleanly.

Not yet done (left for the decisions above): the many README/docs mentions of
`Night_plans/<run>/…` as example output paths, and the hard-coded
`Night_plans/...` defaults inside the run-specific scripts.

## Logs

- 2026-11-09T20:00Z — Claude: ran prompts 1–3. Wrote and debugged
  `scripts/scan_private_targets.py` (inventory, history scan, filter-repo rule
  generator); generated private rules in `pvt_Nighplans/_scrub/`; checked that
  they clean every surviving file; wrote the plan above; switched the plans
  default to `pvt_Nighplans`, updated `.gitignore`, set the `frb_env` env var,
  and updated tests and docs. No git state was modified.
- 2026-11-09T20:23Z — Claude: asked which steps only the owner can do. Added
  the "Who can do which step" table to the plan.
- 2026-11-10T01:42Z — Claude: Lordrick fetched `origin/main` (PR #4,
  `keck-2026oct02`, now merged). Reran the scan: no new leaks, rules
  unchanged; PR refs are now #1–#4. Making the repo private is ruled out, so
  the next step is step 0 (decisions + test fix + rescue docs).
- 2026-11-10T01:49Z — Claude: read LK's D1–D4 answers. Moving the scripts
  showed that 4 run-named scripts are the engine, so they stay with codes
  instead of names; the 13 one-offs plus the run prompts and test1000 were
  copied to pvt (the safety check blocked `rm`, so `git rm` is left to LK).
  Moved the removal list into `target_scrub_paths.txt`. Added to the scan
  script: rules from every historical blob, `extra_rules.txt`, `--apply-to`,
  `--coarse` and `--verify`. The rounded-position check found real positions
  in `test_targets_io.py` (3 spots) and in a HOWTO table; all fixed.
  Rescued the D3 docs and fixed links. Rewrote steps 0–6 for delete and
  re-create. Verify: 0/0/0. Tests: 145 passed.
